## Hardware

| Resource | Minimum | Recommended |
|---|---|---|
| CPU | 48 cores | 96+ cores |
| RAM | 32 GB | 64 GB |
| Disk | 100 GB  | 200 GB  |
| OS | Ubuntu 22.04 / 24.04 | Ubuntu 22.04 LTS |
| Architecture | x86_64 | x86_64 |

## Access

- A [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co) account with an API token that has **read** access to gated models.
- `sudo` privileges on the deployment node.
- Internet access from the node to pull Helm charts and container images.

## SSH Key Setup

Log in as a non-root user with `sudo` privileges. Using `root` or a password-based account may cause unexpected behavior during deployment.

1. **Generate an SSH key pair** (or use an existing one):

   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
   ```

   Leave the password blank when prompted.

2. **Copy the public key** (`id_rsa.pub`) to every control plane and workload node that will be part of the cluster.

3. **Add the public key** to `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` on each node:

   ```bash
   echo "<PUBLIC_KEY_CONTENTS>" >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
   ```

4. **Verify SSH access** from the Ansible control machine to each node:

   ```bash
   chmod 600 <path_to_PRIVATE_KEY>
   ssh -i <path_to_PRIVATE_KEY> <USERNAME>@<IP_ADDRESS>
   ```

   If a bastion host is used, ensure the Ansible control machine can reach the cluster nodes through it.

5. **Configure the Ansible inventory** (`core/inventory/hosts.yaml`) with your node IPs and SSH user. Example templates are provided for both deployment topologies:

   | Topology | Example inventory |
   |---|---|
   | Single node (all-in-one) | [examples/single-node/hosts.yaml](examples/single-node/hosts.yaml) |
   | Multi-node (3 control-plane + N workers) | [examples/multi-node/hosts.yaml](examples/multi-node/hosts.yaml) |

   Copy the appropriate template to `core/inventory/hosts.yaml` and replace `ansible_user`, `ansible_host`, and `ansible_ssh_private_key_file` with your actual values.

## DNS and SSL/TLS Setup

### Production Environment

- Use a registered domain name with DNS records pointing to your server or load balancer.
- Obtain an SSL/TLS certificate from a trusted Certificate Authority (CA) and install it on your system.
- The certificate must cover the base domain **and all use-case subdomains**. For a `cluster_url` of `api.example.com` the following FQDNs need to be covered:

  | FQDN | Purpose |
  |---|---|
  | `api.example.com` | GenAI Gateway (LiteLLM) |
  | `trace-api.example.com` | Langfuse trace UI |

  Request a **multi-SAN** or **wildcard** (`*.api.example.com`) certificate from your CA that includes all of the above.
- Set up automatic renewal or calendar reminders before certificates expire.
- Ensure required firewall ports (e.g., port 80 for HTTP validation) are open during certificate issuance.

### Development Environment

For local testing, `api.example.com` can be mapped to `localhost` or the node's private IP.

1. **Add entries to `/etc/hosts`** for every subdomain the stack uses:

   ```bash
   # Get the private IP of the machine
   hostname -I

   # Add all stack subdomains to /etc/hosts (replace 127.0.0.1 with the node IP if needed)
   # Replace api.example.com with your actual cluster_url
   sudo bash -c 'cat >> /etc/hosts <<EOF
   127.0.0.1 api.example.com
   127.0.0.1 trace-api.example.com
   EOF'
   ```

   The subdomains follow this pattern for a `cluster_url` of `api.example.com`:

   | Host entry | Service |
   |---|---|
   | `api.example.com` | GenAI Gateway (LiteLLM) |
   | `trace-api.example.com` | Langfuse trace UI |

2. **Generate a self-signed SSL certificate** covering all subdomains:

   ```bash
   # Replace api.example.com with your actual cluster_url
   DOMAIN="api.example.com"

   mkdir -p ~/certs && cd ~/certs && \
   openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days 365 -nodes \
     -subj "/CN=${DOMAIN}" \
     -addext "subjectAltName = DNS:${DOMAIN}, DNS:trace-${DOMAIN}"
   ```

   > **Note:** The `-addext` option requires OpenSSL ≥ 1.1.1. If you add more use cases later, regenerate the cert with the additional `DNS:` entries.

   Files generated:
   - `cert.pem` — the self-signed certificate (contains SANs for all subdomains)
   - `key.pem` — the private key

   Set these paths in `core/inventory/agentic-config.cfg`:

   ```ini
   cert_file=/home/<user>/certs/cert.pem
   key_file=/home/<user>/certs/key.pem
   ```
