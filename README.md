## Why This Matters

AI agents are not just smarter chatbots — they are autonomous systems that plan, act, and iterate across multi-step tasks. Building a production-ready agentic AI platform from scratch requires solving a dozen infrastructure problems simultaneously: secure API access, LLM inference routing, agent memory and state management, sandboxed code execution, LLM observability, and enterprise governance.

Most organizations waste months stitching together LiteLLM, Redis, pgvector, Kubernetes, Langfuse, and agent sandboxes. This open source toolkit delivers them pre-integrated, pre-optimized for Intel® Xeon®, and deployable in a single automated workflow.

**The core insight:** GPUs accelerate reasoning. But the *value* of agentic AI comes from end-to-end task execution — and that control plane (state, tools, policy, coordination) runs efficiently on CPUs. This toolkit is designed around that reality, making it the ideal platform for cost-efficient, on-premise, and private AI deployments.

## Business Value at a Glance

| Problem | What the Toolkit Delivers |
|---|---|
| Long time-to-production | One-click Kubernetes deployment — base stack live in hours |
| Integration complexity | All layers pre-integrated: gateway, memory, sandbox, observability |
| Vendor lock-in risk | Provider Design Pattern — swap or extend any component without re-architecting |
| Governance & compliance gaps | Policy-driven API gateway, sandboxed execution, full audit trail |
| GPU cost dependency | CPU-efficient LLM inference by default on Xeon; GPU addable on demand |
| Observability blind spots | Every token, latency, and agent step captured and queryable |
| Adoption friction | Works with LangGraph, CrewAI, Flowise, Microsoft Agent Framework, and any OpenAI-compatible framework |

## Architecture

![Intel® AI for Enterprise Agent Toolkit Architecture](docs/pictures/Enterprise-Agent-Toolkit-Arch-Diagram.png)

The toolkit is organized into **seven pluggable provider blocks**, each with a default implementation and a defined interface. Customers can use the defaults on day one and swap or extend individual providers as their needs evolve — without touching any other layer.

---

## Provider Design Pattern

Each functional block in the toolkit follows a **Provider Design Pattern**: the block defines the capability contract (what it does), not the implementation (how it does it). The default provider is Intel-validated and optimized for Xeon out of the box. Any standard-compliant alternative can be substituted.

This means:
- **No big-bang replacements.** Swap one provider at a time.
- **No lock-in.** The toolkit never mandates a proprietary runtime.
- **Incremental adoption.** Start with all defaults; introduce your own components over time.

---

## Provider Blocks

Each functional block ships with an Intel-validated default. Because the toolkit is built on the Provider Design Pattern, any block can be swapped or extended independently — without touching the rest of the stack.

### API Gateway & Access Control
Unified, secure entry point for all agents, tools, and applications. Routes every request through a policy-driven layer that enforces authentication, authorization, and rate limiting before anything reaches a model or tool. Supports any OpenAI-compatible backend — cloud, on-premise, or hybrid.

**Default provider:** LiteLLM

---

### Intelligent Inference Routing
Automatically dispatches LLM inference workloads to the optimal compute target based on task intent. Reasoning and planning tasks are routed to GPU or cloud/MaaS endpoints; execution, encoding, and coordination tasks are routed to CPU on Xeon. Rules are configurable per application and model-agnostic — works with OpenAI, Anthropic Claude, Google Gemini, and any self-hosted model.

**Default provider:** LiteLLM Semantic Router · Intel Native Inferencing Service (vLLM, SGLang)

---

### Actions & Tools
Gives agents the ability to take actions in the world — call APIs, run code, query databases, and invoke external services — through a governed and extensible tool layer. MCP (Model Context Protocol) server templates let teams register domain-specific tools without modifying the core stack.

**Default provider:** Intel MCP (Model Context Protocol) · ETL / Ingestion Services

---

### Code Execution & Sandbox
Enables agents to safely execute code and run arbitrary actions in isolated environments, preventing runaway agents from affecting production systems. Each sandbox is a fully self-contained ephemeral Kubernetes pod with its own filesystem and process tree. Policy controls limit the blast radius of any single agent action.

**Default provider:** `kubernetes-sigs/agent-sandbox`

---

### Memory, State & Context
Maintains agent memory across the full lifecycle — short-term working context within a session and long-term knowledge across sessions and users. Enables RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), semantic search over past interactions, and stateful multi-turn workflows. Agents maintain context across tasks, sessions, and workflows.

**Default provider:** Redis + RediSearch (short-term) · PostgreSQL + pgvector (long-term)

---

### Observability & Telemetry
Every token, latency measurement, and agent step is captured, stored, and queryable. Provides LLM-native tracing for debugging agent reasoning chains, out-of-the-box dashboards, and seamless integration with existing enterprise monitoring infrastructure — no custom instrumentation required.

**Default provider:** Langfuse · Prometheus · Grafana · Loki

---

### Deployment & Orchestration
Manages the full lifecycle of the stack — provisioning, scaling, updates, and teardown — across single-node and multi-node environments. Supports both production Kubernetes clusters and lightweight Docker Compose for development and demos, using the same configuration.

**Default provider:** Kubernetes · Helm · Docker Compose

---

## Frequently Asked Questions

**What is the Intel® AI for Enterprise Agent Toolkit?**
An open source, Kubernetes-based platform that gives enterprises everything they need to deploy, run, and govern production AI agents on Intel® Xeon® — including LLM gateway, inference routing, agent memory, sandboxed execution, MCP tool integration, and full observability.

**How is this different from LangChain, LangGraph, or CrewAI?**
LangGraph, CrewAI, and similar frameworks handle agent orchestration logic. This toolkit provides the production infrastructure underneath them — the API gateway, inference routing, memory store, sandbox, and observability layer. You use LangGraph or CrewAI *on top of* this toolkit.

**Does it require a GPU?**
No. The toolkit is designed to run AI agent workloads efficiently on Intel® Xeon® CPUs using AMX acceleration. GPU or cloud LLM endpoints (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google) can be added to the same gateway for reasoning-heavy tasks.

**Can I use it with OpenAI, Anthropic Claude, or Google Gemini?**
Yes. The LiteLLM API gateway is fully OpenAI-compatible and supports all major model providers — OpenAI, Anthropic Claude, Google Gemini, SambaNova, and any self-hosted model via vLLM or SGLang.

**Is this suitable for on-premise or air-gapped deployments?**
Yes. The full stack runs on bare metal or private cloud Intel® Xeon® servers with no external dependencies required. Ideal for regulated industries requiring data residency and private AI deployments.

**Can I replace individual components?**
Yes — this is the core design principle. The toolkit is built on the Provider Design Pattern: each block (gateway, memory, observability, etc.) has a default but can be swapped independently without touching other layers.

**What agent frameworks does it support?**
LangGraph, CrewAI, Flowwise, OpenClaw, and any Python-based or OpenAI-compatible orchestration framework.

**How do I get started?**
Clone the repo, run `./deploy-agentic-stack.sh`, and follow the [Quick Start Guide](docs/README.md).
